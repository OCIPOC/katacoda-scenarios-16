Before we deploy cassandra, we will need to create a Portworx volume (PVC) for Cassandra. In order to create PVCs, we need a StorageClass which defined the class of storage available to us.

### Step: Create StorageClass

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f cassandra-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}



Now use kubectl to deploy Cassandra.
```
kubectl create -f cassandra.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify Cassandra pod is ready

Below commands wait till the Cassandra pod are in ready state. Take note of the node it's running on.
```
watch kubectl get pods  -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

This takes a few minutes, when the cassandra-0 and cqlsh pods are in STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.


In this step, we will initialize a sample database in our cassandra instance.

### Step: Create a table and insert data

Start a CQL Shell session:
```
kubectl exec -it cqlsh -- cqlsh cassandra-0.cassandra.default.svc.cluster.local --cqlversion=3.4.4
```{{execute T1}}

### Create a Song Library that contains a list of songs, including the song name, artist name, year, album it was from, and if it was a single.

```
CREATE KEYSPACE portworx WITH REPLICATION = {'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':3};
USE portworx;
```{{execute T1}}


```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS songs (song_title text, artist_name text, year int, album_name text,single text, PRIMARY KEY (year, artist_name));
```{{execute T1}}

### TO-DO: Insert the following two rows in your table
`First Row:  "Across The Universe", "The Beatles", "1970", "False", "Let It Be"`

`Second Row: "The Beatles", "Think For Yourself", "False", "1965", "Rubber Soul"`


```
INSERT INTO portworx.songs(song_title,artist_name,  year,album_name,single) VALUES('Across The Universe', 'The Beatles', 1970, 'Let It Be', 'False');
```{{execute T1}}
```
INSERT INTO portworx.songs(song_title,artist_name,  year,album_name, single) VALUES("Think For Yourself", "The Beatles", 1965, "Let It Be", "False");
```{{execute T1}}

### TO-DO: Validate your data was inserted into the table.

```
SELECT * FROM portworx.songs WHERE();
```{{execute T1}}
