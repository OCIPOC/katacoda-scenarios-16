#### Moving to 3rd Normal Form (3NF)
Let's check our table for any transitive dependencies. Transactions can remove Cashier Name to its own table, called Employees, which will leave us with 3 tables. 
`Table Name: transactions2 
column 0: transaction Id
column 1: Customer Name
column 2: Cashier Id
column 3: Year `

`Table Name: albums_sold
column 0: Album Id
column 1: Transaction Id
column 3: Album Name` 

`Table Name: employees
column 0: Employee Id
column 1: Employee Name `

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions2 (transaction_id int, 
                                                           customer_name varchar, cashier_id int, 
                                                           year int);
```{{execute}}

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (employee_id int, 
                                                       employee_name varchar);
```{{execute}}

``` {.sql}
INSERT INTO transactions2(transaction_id, customer_name, cashier_id, year) VALUES (1, "Amanda", 1, 2000), (2, "Toby", 1, 2000), (3, "Max", 2, 2018);
```{{execute}}

``` {.sql}
INSERT INTO employees(employee_id, employee_name) VALUES (1, "Sam"), (2, "Bob"), (3, "Max", 2, 2018);
```{{execute}}
